# My solutions for Advent of Code

Requirements:
* `poetry` (https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
* `make` (I used `sudo apt install make`)

How to use:
* Set up `poetry` environment by running `make env`.
* Run scripts with `poetry run 2021/01.py` etc.
* Format scripts by running `make format`.
